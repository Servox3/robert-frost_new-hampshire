<h2 id="ch1">NEW HAMPSHIRE</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I met a lady from the South who said</p>
<p class="t0">(You won’t believe she said it, but she said it):</p>
<p class="t0">“None of my family ever worked, or had</p>
<p class="t0">A thing to sell.” I don’t suppose the work</p>
<p class="t0">Much matters. You may work for all of me.</p>
<p class="t0">I’ve seen the time I’ve had to work myself.</p>
<p class="t0">The having anything to sell<a class="fn" href="#fn_1" id="fr_1">[1]</a> is what</p>
<p class="t0">Is the disgrace in man or state or nation.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I met a traveller from Arkansas</p>
<p class="t0">Who boasted of his state as beautiful</p>
<p class="t0">For diamonds and apples. “Diamonds</p>
<p class="t0">And apples in commercial quantities?”</p>
<p class="t0">I asked him, on my guard. “Oh yes,” he answered,</p>
<p class="t0">Off his. The time was evening in the Pullman.</p>
<p class="t0">“I see the porter’s made your bed,” I told him.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I met a Californian who would</p>
<p class="t0">Talk California—a state so blessed,</p>
<p class="t0">He said, in climate none had ever died there</p>
<p class="t0">A natural death, and Vigilance Committees</p>
<p class="t0">Had had to organize to stock the graveyards</p>
<p class="t0">And vindicate the state’s humanity.</p>
<p class="t0">“Just the way Steffanson runs on,” I murmured,</p>
<p class="t0">“About the British Arctic. That’s what comes</p>
<p class="t0">Of being in the market with a climate.”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I met a poet from another state,</p>
<p class="t0">A zealot full of fluid inspiration,</p>
<p class="t0">Who in the name of fluid inspiration,</p>
<p class="t0">But in the best style of bad salesmanship,</p>
<p class="t0">Angrily tried to make me write a protest</p>
<p class="t0">(In verse I think) against the Volstead Act.</p>
<p class="t0">He didn’t even offer me a drink</p>
<p class="t0">Until I asked for one to steady <i>him</i>.</p>
<p class="t0">This is called having an idea to sell.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It never could have happened in New Hampshire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The only person really soiled with trade</p>
<p class="t0">I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire</p>
<p class="t0">Was someone who had just come back ashamed</p>
<p class="t0">From selling things in California.</p>
<p class="t0">He’d built a noble mansard roof with balls</p>
<p class="t0">On turrets like Constantinople, deep</p>
<p class="t0">In woods some ten miles from a railroad station,</p>
<p class="t0">As if to put forever out of mind</p>
<p class="t0">The hope of being, as we say, received.</p>
<p class="t0">I found him standing at the close of day</p>
<p class="t0">Inside the threshold of his open barn,</p>
<p class="t0">Like a lone actor on a gloomy stage—</p>
<p class="t0">And recognized him through the iron grey</p>
<p class="t0">In which his face was muffled to the eyes</p>
<p class="t0">As an old boyhood friend, and once indeed</p>
<p class="t0">A drover with me on the road to Brighton.</p>
<p class="t0">His farm was “grounds,” and not a farm at all;</p>
<p class="t0">His house among the local sheds and shanties</p>
<p class="t0">Rose like a factor’s at a trading station.</p>
<p class="t0">And he was rich, and I was still a rascal.</p>
<p class="t0">I couldn’t keep from asking impolitely,</p>
<p class="t0">Where had he been and what had he been doing?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p class="t0">How did he get so? (Rich was understood.)</p>
<p class="t0">In dealing in “old rags” in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh it was terrible as well could be.</p>
<p class="t0">We both of us turned over in our graves.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Just specimens is all New Hampshire has,</p>
<p class="t0">One each of everything as in a show-case</p>
<p class="t0">Which naturally she doesn’t care to sell.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She had one President (pronounce him Purse,</p>
<p class="t0">And make the most of it for better or worse.</p>
<p class="t0">He’s your one chance to score against the state).</p>
<p class="t0">She had one Daniel Webster. He was all</p>
<p class="t0">The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be.</p>
<p class="t0">She had the Dartmouth needed to produce him.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I call her old. She has one family</p>
<p class="t0">Whose claim is good to being settled here</p>
<p class="t0">Before the era of colonization,</p>
<p class="t0">And before that of exploration even.</p>
<p class="t0">John Smith remarked them as he coasted by</p>
<p class="t0">Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf</p>
<p class="t0">At the Isles of Shoals, and satisfied himself</p>
<p class="t0">They weren’t Red Indians but veritable</p>
<p class="t0">Pre-primitives of the white race, dawn people,</p>
<p class="t0">Like those who furnished Adam’s sons with wives;</p>
<p class="t0">However uninnocent they may have been</p>
<p class="t0">In being there so early in our history.</p>
<p class="t0">They’d been there then a hundred years or more.</p>
<p class="t0">Pity he didn’t ask what they were up to</p>
<p class="t0">At that date with a wharf already built,</p>
<p class="t0">And take their name. They’ve since told me their name—</p>
<p class="t0">Today an honored one in Nottingham.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As for what they were up to more than fishing—</p>
<p class="t0">Suppose they weren’t behaving Puritanly,</p>
<p class="t0">The hour had not yet struck for being good,</p>
<p class="t0">Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical.</p>
<p class="t0">It became an explorer of the deep</p>
<p class="t0">Not to explore too deep in others’ business.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Did you but know of him, New Hampshire has</p>
<p class="t0">One real reformer who would change the world</p>
<p class="t0">So it would be accepted by two classes,</p>
<p class="t0">Artists the minute they set up as artists,</p>
<p class="t0">Before, that is, they are themselves accepted,</p>
<p class="t0">And boys the minute they get out of college.</p>
<p class="t0">I can’t help thinking those are tests to go by.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And she has one I don’t know what to call him,</p>
<p class="t0">Who comes from Philadelphia every year</p>
<p class="t0">With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds</p>
<p class="t0">He wants to give the educational</p>
<p class="t0">Advantages of growing almost wild</p>
<p class="t0">Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle—</p>
<p class="t0">Dorkings because they’re spoken of by Chaucer,</p>
<p class="t0">Sussex because they’re spoken of by Herrick.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She has a touch of gold. New Hampshire gold—<a class="fn" href="#fn_2" id="fr_2">[2]</a></p>
<p class="t0">You may have heard of it. I had a farm</p>
<p class="t0">Offered me not long since up Berlin way</p>
<p class="t0">With a mine on it that was worked for gold;</p>
<p class="t0">But not gold in commercial quantities.</p>
<p class="t0">Just enough gold to make the engagement rings</p>
<p class="t0">And marriage rings of those who owned the farm.</p>
<p class="t0">What gold more innocent could one have asked for?</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">One of my children ranging after rocks</p>
<p class="t0">Lately brought home from Andover or Canaan</p>
<p class="t0">A specimen of beryl with a trace</p>
<p class="t0">Of radium. I know with radium</p>
<p class="t0">The trace would have to be the merest trace</p>
<p class="t0">To be below the threshold of commercial,</p>
<p class="t0">But trust New Hampshire not to have enough</p>
<p class="t0">Of radium or anything to sell.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A specimen of everything, I said.</p>
<p class="t0">She has one witch—old style.<a class="fn" href="#fn_3" id="fr_3">[3]</a> She lives in Colebrook.</p>
<p class="t0">(The only other witch I ever met</p>
<p class="t0">Was lately at a cut-glass dinner in Boston.</p>
<p class="t0">There were four candles and four people present.</p>
<p class="t0">The witch was young, and beautiful (new style),</p>
<p class="t0">And open-minded. She was free to question</p>
<p class="t0">Her gift for reading letters locked in boxes.</p>
<p class="t0">Why was it so much greater when the boxes</p>
<p class="t0">Were metal than it was when they were wooden?</p>
<p class="t0">It made the world seem so mysterious.</p>
<p class="t0">The S’ciety for Psychical Research</p>
<p class="t0">Was cognizant. Her husband was worth millions.</p>
<p class="t0">I think he owned some shares in Harvard College.)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">New Hampshire <i>used</i> to have at Salem</p>
<p class="t0">A company we called the White Corpuscles,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose duty was at any hour of night</p>
<p class="t0">To rush in sheets and fool’s caps where they smelled</p>
<p class="t0">A thing the least bit doubtfully perscented</p>
<p class="t0">And give someone the Skipper Ireson’s Ride.</p>
<p class="t0">One each of everything as in a show-case.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p class="t0">More than enough land for a specimen</p>
<p class="t0">You’ll say she has, but there there enters in</p>
<p class="t0">Something else to protect her from herself.</p>
<p class="t0">There quality<a class="fn" href="#fn_4" id="fr_4">[4]</a> makes up for quantity.</p>
<p class="t0">Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale.</p>
<p class="t0">The farm I made my home on in the mountains</p>
<p class="t0">I had to take by force rather than buy.</p>
<p class="t0">I caught the owner outdoors by himself</p>
<p class="t0">Raking up after winter, and I said,</p>
<p class="t0">“I’m going to put you off this farm: I want it.”</p>
<p class="t0">“Where are you going to put me? In the road?”</p>
<p class="t0">“I’m going to put you on the farm next to it.”</p>
<p class="t0">“Why won’t the farm next to it do for you?”</p>
<p class="t0">“I like this better.” It was really better.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Apples? New Hampshire has them, but unsprayed,</p>
<p class="t0">With no suspicion in stem-end or blossom-end</p>
<p class="t0">Of vitriol or arsenate of lead,</p>
<p class="t0">And so not good for anything but cider.</p>
<p class="t0">Her unpruned grapes are flung like lariats</p>
<p class="t0">Far up the birches out of reach of man.<a class="fn" href="#fn_5" id="fr_5">[5]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A state producing precious metals, stones,</p>
<p class="t0">And—writing; none of these except perhaps</p>
<p class="t0">The precious literature in quantity</p>
<p class="t0">Or quality to worry the producer</p>
<p class="t0">About disposing of it. Do you know,</p>
<p class="t0">Considering the market, there are more</p>
<p class="t0">Poems produced than any other thing?<a class="fn" href="#fn_6" id="fr_6">[6]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p class="t0">No wonder poets sometimes have to <i>seem</i></p>
<p class="t0">So much more business-like than business men.</p>
<p class="t0">Their wares are so much harder to get rid of.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She’s one of the two best states in the Union.</p>
<p class="t0">Vermont’s the other. And the two have been</p>
<p class="t0">Yoke-fellows in the sap-yoke from of old</p>
<p class="t0">In many Marches.<a class="fn" href="#fn_7" id="fr_7">[7]</a> And they lie like wedges,</p>
<p class="t0">Thick end to thin end and thin end to thick end,</p>
<p class="t0">And are a figure of the way the strong</p>
<p class="t0">Of mind and strong of arm should fit together,</p>
<p class="t0">One thick where one is thin and vice versa.</p>
<p class="t0">New Hampshire raises the Connecticut</p>
<p class="t0">In a trout hatchery near Canada,</p>
<p class="t0">But soon divides the river with Vermont.</p>
<p class="t0">Both are delightful states for their absurdly</p>
<p class="t0">Small towns—Lost Nation, Bungey, Muddy Boo,</p>
<p class="t0">Poplin, Still Corners (so called not because</p>
<p class="t0">The place is silent all day long, nor yet</p>
<p class="t0">Because it boasts a whisky still—because</p>
<p class="t0">It set out once to be a city and still</p>
<p class="t0">Is only corners, cross-roads in a wood).</p>
<p class="t0">And I remember one whose name appeared</p>
<p class="t0">Between the pictures on a movie screen</p>
<p class="t0">Election<a class="fn" href="#fn_8" id="fr_8">[8]</a> night once in Franconia,</p>
<p class="t0">When everything had gone Republican</p>
<p class="t0">And Democrats were sore in need of comfort:</p>
<p class="t0">Easton goes Democratic, Wilson 4</p>
<p class="t0">Hughes 2. And everybody to the saddest</p>
<p class="t0">Laughed the loud laugh, the big laugh at the little.</p>
<p class="t0">New York (five million) laughs at Manchester,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p class="t0">Manchester (sixty or seventy thousand) laughs</p>
<p class="t0">At Littleton (four thousand), Littleton</p>
<p class="t0">Laughs at Franconia (seven hundred), and</p>
<p class="t0">Franconia laughs, I fear,—did laugh that night—</p>
<p class="t0">At Easton. What has Easton left to laugh at,</p>
<p class="t0">And like the actress exclaim, “Oh my God” at?</p>
<p class="t0">There’s Bungey; and for Bungey there are towns,</p>
<p class="t0">Whole townships named but without population.<a class="fn" href="#fn_9" id="fr_9">[9]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Anything I can say about New Hampshire</p>
<p class="t0">Will serve almost as well about Vermont,</p>
<p class="t0">Excepting that they differ in their mountains.</p>
<p class="t0">The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight;</p>
<p class="t0">New Hampshire mountains curl up in a coil.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I had been coming to New Hampshire mountains.</p>
<p class="t0">And here I am and what am I to say?</p>
<p class="t0">Here first my theme becomes embarrassing.</p>
<p class="t0">Emerson said, “The God who made New Hampshire</p>
<p class="t0">Taunted the lofty land with little men.”</p>
<p class="t0">Another Massachusetts poet said,</p>
<p class="t0">“I go no more to summer in New Hampshire.</p>
<p class="t0">I’ve given up my summer place in Dublin.”</p>
<p class="t0">But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire,</p>
<p class="t0">She said she couldn’t stand the people in it,</p>
<p class="t0">The little men (it’s Massachusetts speaking).</p>
<p class="t0">And when I asked to know what ailed the people,</p>
<p class="t0">She said, “Go read your own books and find out.”</p>
<p class="t0">I may as well confess myself the author</p>
<p class="t0">Of several books against the world in general.</p>
<p class="t0">To take them as against a special state</p>
<p class="t0">Or even nation’s to restrict my meaning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p class="t0">I’m what is called a sensibilitist,</p>
<p class="t0">Or otherwise an environmentalist.</p>
<p class="t0">I refuse to adapt myself a mite</p>
<p class="t0">To any change from hot to cold, from wet</p>
<p class="t0">To dry, from poor to rich, or back again.</p>
<p class="t0">I make a virtue of my suffering</p>
<p class="t0">From nearly everything that goes on round me.<a class="fn" href="#fn_10" id="fr_10">[10]</a></p>
<p class="t0">In other words, I know wherever I am,</p>
<p class="t0">Being the creature of literature I am,</p>
<p class="t0">I shall not lack for pain to keep me awake.</p>
<p class="t0">Kit Marlowe taught me how to say my prayers:</p>
<p class="t0">“Why this is Hell, nor am I out of it.”</p>
<p class="t0">Samoa, Russia, Ireland I complain of,</p>
<p class="t0">No less than England, France and Italy.</p>
<p class="t0">Because I wrote my novels in New Hampshire</p>
<p class="t0">Is no proof that I aimed them at New Hampshire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When I left Massachusetts years ago</p>
<p class="t0">Between two days, the reason why I sought</p>
<p class="t0">New Hampshire, not Connecticut,</p>
<p class="t0">Rhode Island, New York, or Vermont was this:</p>
<p class="t0">Where I was living then, New Hampshire offered</p>
<p class="t0">The nearest boundary to escape across.</p>
<p class="t0">I hadn’t an illusion in my hand-bag</p>
<p class="t0">About the people being better there</p>
<p class="t0">Than those I left behind. I thought they weren’t.</p>
<p class="t0">I thought they couldn’t be. And yet they were.</p>
<p class="t0">I’d sure had no such friends in Massachusetts</p>
<p class="t0">As Hall of Windham, Gay of Atkinson,<a class="fn" href="#fn_11" id="fr_11">[11]</a></p>
<p class="t0">Bartlett of Raymond (now of Colorado),</p>
<p class="t0">Harris of Derry, and Lynch of Bethlehem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p class="t0">The glorious bards of Massachusetts seem</p>
<p class="t0">To want to make New Hampshire people over.</p>
<p class="t0">They taunt the lofty land with little men.</p>
<p class="t0">I don’t know what to say about the people.</p>
<p class="t0">For art’s sake one could almost wish them worse<a class="fn" href="#fn_12" id="fr_12">[12]</a></p>
<p class="t0">Rather than better. How are we to write</p>
<p class="t0">The Russian novel in America</p>
<p class="t0">As long as life goes so unterribly?</p>
<p class="t0">There is the pinch from which our only outcry</p>
<p class="t0">In literature to date is heard to come.</p>
<p class="t0">We get what little misery we can</p>
<p class="t0">Out of not having cause for misery.</p>
<p class="t0">It makes the guild of novel writers sick</p>
<p class="t0">To be expected to be Dostoievskis</p>
<p class="t0">On nothing worse than too much luck and comfort.</p>
<p class="t0">This is not sorrow, though; it’s just the vapors,</p>
<p class="t0">And recognized as such in Russia itself</p>
<p class="t0">Under the new régime, and so forbidden.</p>
<p class="t0">If well it is with Russia, then feel free</p>
<p class="t0">To say so or be stood against the wall</p>
<p class="t0">And shot. It’s Pollyanna now or death.</p>
<p class="t0">This, then, is the new freedom we hear tell of;</p>
<p class="t0">And very sensible. No state can build</p>
<p class="t0">A literature that shall at once be sound</p>
<p class="t0">And sad on a foundation of wellbeing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To show the level of intelligence</p>
<p class="t0">Among us; it was just a Warren farmer</p>
<p class="t0">Whose horse had pulled him short up in the road</p>
<p class="t0">By me, a stranger. This is what he said,</p>
<p class="t0">From nothing but embarrassment and want</p>

<p class="t0">We’ve heard against the Mid-Victorians</p>
<p class="t0">And never rightly understood till Bryan</p>
<p class="t0">Retired from politics and joined the chorus.</p>
<p class="t0">The matter with the Mid-Victorians</p>
<p class="t0">Seems to have been a man named John L. Darwin.”<a class="fn" href="#fn_14" id="fr_14">[14]</a></p>
<p class="t0">“Go ’long,” I said to him, he to his horse.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I knew a man who failing as a farmer</p>
<p class="t0">Burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance,</p>
<p class="t0">And spent the proceeds on a telescope<a class="fn" href="#fn_15" id="fr_15">[15]</a></p>
<p class="t0">To satisfy a life-long curiosity</p>
<p class="t0">About our place among the infinities.</p>
<p class="t0">And how was that for other-worldliness?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If I must choose which I would elevate—</p>
<p class="t0">The people or the already lofty mountains,</p>
<p class="t0">I’d elevate the already lofty mountains.</p>
<p class="t0">The only fault I find with old New Hampshire</p>
<p class="t0">Is that her mountains aren’t quite high enough.</p>
<p class="t0">I was not always so; I’ve come to be so.</p>
<p class="t0">How, to my sorrow, how have I attained</p>
<p class="t0">A height from which to look down critical</p>
<p class="t0">On mountains? What has given me assurance</p>
<p class="t0">To say what height becomes New Hampshire mountains,</p>
<p class="t0">Or any mountains? Can it be some strength</p>
<p class="t0">I feel as of an earthquake in my back</p>
<p class="t0">To heave them higher to the morning star?</p>
<p class="t0">Can it be foreign travel in the Alps?</p>
<p class="t0">Or having seen and credited a moment</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p class="t0">The solid moulding of vast peaks of cloud</p>
<p class="t0">Behind the pitiful reality</p>
<p class="t0">Of Lincoln, Lafayette and Liberty?</p>
<p class="t0">Or some such sense as says how high shall jet</p>
<p class="t0">The fountain in proportion to the basin?</p>
<p class="t0">No, none of these has raised me to my throne</p>
<p class="t0">Of intellectual dissatisfaction,</p>
<p class="t0">But the sad accident of having seen</p>
<p class="t0">Our actual mountains given in a map</p>
<p class="t0">Of early times as twice the height they are—</p>
<p class="t0">Ten thousand feet instead of only five—</p>
<p class="t0">Which shows how sad an accident may be.</p>
<p class="t0">Five thousand is no longer high enough.</p>
<p class="t0">Whereas I never had a good idea</p>
<p class="t0">About improving people in the world,</p>
<p class="t0">Here I am over-fertile in suggestion,</p>
<p class="t0">And cannot rest from planning day or night</p>
<p class="t0">How high I’d thrust the peaks in summer snow</p>
<p class="t0">To tap the upper sky and draw a flow</p>
<p class="t0">Of frosty night air on the vale below</p>
<p class="t0">Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The more the sensibilitist I am</p>
<p class="t0">The more I seem to want my mountains wild;</p>
<p class="t0">The way the wiry gang-boss liked the log-jam.<a class="fn" href="#fn_16" id="fr_16">[16]</a></p>
<p class="t0">After he’d picked the lock and got it started,</p>
<p class="t0">He dodged a log that lifted like an arm</p>
<p class="t0">Against the sky to break his back for him,</p>
<p class="t0">Then came in dancing, skipping, with his life</p>
<p class="t0">Across the roar and chaos, and the words</p>
<p class="t0">We saw him say along the zigzag journey</p>
<p class="t0">Were doubtless as the words we heard him say</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p class="t0">On coming nearer: “Wasn’t she an <i>i</i>-deal</p>
<p class="t0">Son-of-a-bitch? You bet she was an <i>i</i>-deal.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For all her mountains fall a little short,</p>
<p class="t0">Her people not quite short enough for Art,</p>
<p class="t0">She’s still New Hampshire, a most restful state.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lately in converse with a New York alec</p>
<p class="t0">About the new school of the pseudo-phallic,</p>
<p class="t0">I found myself in a close corner where</p>
<p class="t0">I had to make an almost funny choice.</p>
<p class="t0">“Choose you which you will be—a prude, or puke,</p>
<p class="t0">Mewling and puking in the public arms.”</p>
<p class="t0">“Me for the hills where I don’t have to choose.”<a class="fn" href="#fn_17" id="fr_17">[17]</a></p>
<p class="t0">“But if you had to choose, which would you be?”</p>
<p class="t0">I wouldn’t be a prude afraid of nature.</p>
<p class="t0">I know a man who took a double axe</p>
<p class="t0">And went alone against a grove of trees;</p>
<p class="t0">But his heart failing him, he dropped the axe</p>
<p class="t0">And ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold:</p>
<p class="t0">“Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood;</p>
<p class="t0">There’s been enough shed without shedding mine.</p>
<p class="t0">Remember Birnam Wood! The wood’s in flux!”</p>
<p class="t0">He had a special terror of the flux</p>
<p class="t0">That showed itself in dendrophobia.</p>
<p class="t0">The only decent tree had been to mill</p>
<p class="t0">And educated into boards, he said.</p>
<p class="t0">He knew too well for any earthly use</p>
<p class="t0">The line where man leaves off and nature starts,<a class="fn" href="#fn_18" id="fr_18">[18]</a></p>
<p class="t0">And never over-stepped it save in dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p class="t0">He stood on the safe side of the line talking;</p>
<p class="t0">Which is sheer Matthew Arnoldism,</p>
<p class="t0">The cult of one who owned himself “a foiled,</p>
<p class="t0">Circuitous wanderer,” and “took dejectedly</p>
<p class="t0">His seat upon the intellectual throne.”</p>
<p class="t0">Agreed in frowning on these improvised</p>
<p class="t0">Altars the woods are full of nowadays,</p>
<p class="t0">Again as in the days when Ahaz sinned</p>
<p class="t0">By worship under green trees in the open.</p>
<p class="t0">Scarcely a mile but that I come on one,</p>
<p class="t0">A black-cheeked stone and stick of rain-washed charcoal.</p>
<p class="t0">Even to say the groves were God’s first temples</p>
<p class="t0">Comes too near to Ahaz’ sin for safety.</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing not built with hands of course is sacred.</p>
<p class="t0">But here is not a question of what’s sacred;</p>
<p class="t0">Rather of what to face or run away from.</p>
<p class="t0">I’d hate to be a runaway from nature.</p>
<p class="t0">And neither would I choose to be a puke</p>
<p class="t0">Who cares not what he does in company,</p>
<p class="t0">And, when he can’t do anything, falls back</p>
<p class="t0">On words, and tries his worst to make words speak</p>
<p class="t0">Louder than actions, and sometimes achieves it.</p>
<p class="t0">It seems a narrow choice the age insists on.</p>
<p class="t0">How about being a good Greek, for instance?</p>
<p class="t0">That course, they tell me, isn’t offered this year.</p>
<p class="t0">“Come, but this isn’t choosing—puke or prude?”</p>
<p class="t0">Well, if I have to choose one or the other,</p>
<p class="t0">I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer</p>
<p class="t0">With an income in cash of say a thousand</p>
<p class="t0">(From say a publisher in New York City).</p>
<p class="t0">It’s restful to arrive at a decision,</p>
<p class="t0">And restful just to think about New Hampshire.</p>
<p class="t0">At present I am living in Vermont.</p>

<br/><span class="small">(<i>For Lincoln MacVeagh</i>)</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Never tell me that not one star of all</p>
<p class="t0">That slip from heaven at night and softly fall</p>
<p class="t0">Has been picked up with stones to build a wall.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Some laborer found one faded and stone cold,</p>
<p class="t0">And saving that its weight suggested gold,</p>
<p class="t0">And tugged it from his first too certain hold,</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He noticed nothing in it to remark.</p>
<p class="t0">He was not used to handling stars thrown dark</p>
<p class="t0">And lifeless from an interrupted arc.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He did not recognize in that smooth coal</p>
<p class="t0">The one thing palpable besides the soul</p>
<p class="t0">To penetrate the air in which we roll.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He did not see how like a flying thing</p>
<p class="t0">It brooded ant-eggs, and had one large wing,</p>
<p class="t0">One not so large for flying in a ring,</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And a long Bird of Paradise’s tail,</p>
<p class="t0">(Though these when not in use to fly and trail</p>
<p class="t0">It drew back in its body like a snail);</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nor know that he might move it from the spot</p>
<p class="t0">The harm was done; from having been star-shot</p>
<p class="t0">The very nature of the soil was hot</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And burning to yield flowers instead of grain,</p>
<p class="t0">Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain</p>
<p class="t0">Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He moved it roughly with an iron bar,</p>
<p class="t0">He loaded an old stone-boat with the star</p>
<p class="t0">And not, as you might think, a flying car,</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Such as even poets would admit perforce</p>
<p class="t0">More practical than Pegasus the horse</p>
<p class="t0">If it could put a star back in its course.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He dragged it through the ploughed ground at a pace</p>
<p class="t0">But faintly reminiscent of the race</p>
<p class="t0">Of jostling rock in interstellar space.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It went for building stone, and I, as though</p>
<p class="t0">Commanded in a dream, forever go</p>
<p class="t0">To right the wrong that this should have been so.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet ask where else it could have gone as well,</p>
<p class="t0">I do not know—I cannot stop to tell:</p>
<p class="t0">He might have left it lying where it fell.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">From following walls I never lift my eye</p>
<p class="t0">Except at night to places in the sky</p>
<p class="t0">Where showers of charted meteors let fly.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Some may know what they seek in school and church,</p>
<p class="t0">And why they seek it there; for what I search</p>
<p class="t0">I must go measuring stone walls, perch on perch;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sure that though not a star of death and birth,</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Though not, I say, a star of death and sin,</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm</p>

<h2 id="ch3">THE CENSUS-TAKER</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I came an errand one cloud-blowing evening</p>
<p class="t0">To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house</p>
<p class="t0">Of one room and one window and one door,</p>
<p class="t0">The only dwelling in a waste cut over</p>
<p class="t0">A hundred square miles round it in the mountains:</p>
<p class="t0">And that not dwelt in now by men or women</p>
<p class="t0">(It never had been dwelt in, though, by women,</p>
<p class="t0">So what is this I make a sorrow of?)</p>
<p class="t0">I came as census-taker to the waste</p>
<p class="t0">To count the people in it and found none,</p>
<p class="t0">None in the hundred miles, none in the house,</p>
<p class="t0">Where I came last with some hope, but not much</p>
<p class="t0">After hours’ overlooking from the cliffs</p>
<p class="t0">An emptiness flayed to the very stone.</p>
<p class="t0">I found no people that dared show themselves,</p>
<p class="t0">None not in hiding from the outward eye.</p>
<p class="t0">The time was autumn, but how anyone</p>
<p class="t0">Could tell the time of year when every tree</p>
<p class="t0">That could have dropped a leaf was down itself</p>
<p class="t0">And nothing but the stump of it was left</p>
<p class="t0">Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch;</p>
<p class="t0">And every tree up stood a rotting trunk</p>
<p class="t0">Without a single leaf to spend on autumn,</p>
<p class="t0">Or branch to whistle after what was spent.</p>
<p class="t0">Perhaps the wind the more without the help</p>
<p class="t0">Of breathing trees said something of the time</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p class="t0">Of year or day the way it swung a door</p>
<p class="t0">Forever off the latch, as if rude men</p>
<p class="t0">Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him</p>
<p class="t0">For the next one to open for himself.</p>
<p class="t0">I counted nine I had no right to count</p>
<p class="t0">(But this was dreamy unofficial counting)</p>
<p class="t0">Before I made the tenth across the threshold.</p>
<p class="t0">Where was my supper? Where was anyone’s?</p>
<p class="t0">No lamp was lit. Nothing was on the table.</p>
<p class="t0">The stove was cold—the stove was off the chimney—</p>
<p class="t0">And down by one side where it lacked a leg.</p>
<p class="t0">The people that had loudly passed the door</p>
<p class="t0">Were people to the ear but not the eye.</p>
<p class="t0">They were not on the table with their elbows.</p>
<p class="t0">They were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks.</p>
<p class="t0">I saw no men there and no bones of men there.</p>
<p class="t0">I armed myself against such bones as might be</p>
<p class="t0">With the pitch-blackened stub of an axe-handle</p>
<p class="t0">I picked up off the straw-dust covered floor.</p>
<p class="t0">Not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled.</p>
<p class="t0">The door was still because I held it shut</p>
<p class="t0">While I thought what to do that could be done—</p>
<p class="t0">About the house—about the people not there.</p>
<p class="t0">This house in one year fallen to decay</p>
<p class="t0">Filled me with no less sorrow than the houses</p>
<p class="t0">Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years</p>
<p class="t0">Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe.</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing was left to do that I could see</p>
<p class="t0">Unless to find that there was no one there</p>
<p class="t0">And declare to the cliffs too far for echo</p>
<p class="t0">“The place is desert and let whoso lurks</p>
<p class="t0">In silence, if in this he is aggrieved,</p>
<p class="t0">Break silence now or be forever silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p class="t0">Let him say why it should not be declared so.”</p>
<p class="t0">The melancholy of having to count souls</p>
<p class="t0">Where they grow fewer and fewer every year</p>
<p class="t0">Is extreme where they shrink to none at all.</p>
<p class="t0">It must be I want life to go on living.</p>

<h2 id="ch4">THE STAR-SPLITTER</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“You know Orion always comes up sideways.</p>
<p class="t0">Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,</p>
<p class="t0">And rising on his hands, he looks in on me</p>
<p class="t0">Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something</p>
<p class="t0">I should have done by daylight, and indeed,</p>
<p class="t0">After the ground is frozen, I should have done</p>
<p class="t0">Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful</p>
<p class="t0">Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney</p>
<p class="t0">To make fun of my way of doing things,</p>
<p class="t0">Or else fun of Orion’s having caught me.</p>
<p class="t0">Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights</p>
<p class="t0">These forces are obliged to pay respect to?”</p>
<p class="t0">So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk</p>
<p class="t0">Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,</p>
<p class="t0">Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming,</p>
<p class="t0">He burned his house down for the fire insurance</p>
<p class="t0">And spent the proceeds on a telescope</p>
<p class="t0">To satisfy a life-long curiosity</p>
<p class="t0">About our place among the infinities.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“What do you want with one of those blame things?”</p>
<p class="t0">I asked him well beforehand. “Don’t you get one!”</p>
<p class="t0">“Don’t call it blamed; there isn’t anything</p>
<p class="t0">More blameless in the sense of being less</p>
<p class="t0">A weapon in our human fight,” he said.</p>
<p class="t0">“I’ll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.”</p>
<p class="t0">There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p class="t0">And plowed between the rocks he couldn’t move</p>
<p class="t0">Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years</p>
<p class="t0">Trying to sell his farm and then not selling,</p>
<p class="t0">He burned his house down for the fire insurance</p>
<p class="t0">And bought the telescope with what it came to.</p>
<p class="t0">He had been heard to say by several:</p>
<p class="t0">“The best thing that we’re put here for’s to see;</p>
<p class="t0">The strongest thing that’s given us to see with’s</p>
<p class="t0">A telescope. Someone in every town</p>
<p class="t0">Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one.</p>
<p class="t0">In Littleton it may as well be me.”</p>
<p class="t0">After such loose talk it was no surprise</p>
<p class="t0">When he did what he did and burned his house down.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Mean laughter went about the town that day</p>
<p class="t0">To let him know we weren’t the least imposed on,</p>
<p class="t0">And he could wait—we’d see to him to-morrow.</p>
<p class="t0">But the first thing next morning we reflected</p>
<p class="t0">If one by one we counted people out</p>
<p class="t0">For the least sin, it wouldn’t take us long</p>
<p class="t0">To get so we had no one left to live with.</p>
<p class="t0">For to be social is to be forgiving.</p>
<p class="t0">Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,</p>
<p class="t0">We don’t cut off from coming to church suppers,</p>
<p class="t0">But what we miss we go to him and ask for.</p>
<p class="t0">He promptly gives it back, that is if still</p>
<p class="t0">Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of.</p>
<p class="t0">It wouldn’t do to be too hard on Brad</p>
<p class="t0">About his telescope. Beyond the age</p>
<p class="t0">Of being given one’s gift for Christmas,</p>
<p class="t0">He had to take the best way he knew how</p>
<p class="t0">To find himself in one. Well, all we said was</p>
<p class="t0">He took a strange thing to be roguish over.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Some sympathy was wasted on the house,</p>
<p class="t0">A good old-timer dating back along;</p>
<p class="t0">But a house isn’t sentient; the house</p>
<p class="t0">Didn’t feel anything. And if it did,</p>
<p class="t0">Why not regard it as a sacrifice,</p>
<p class="t0">And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,</p>
<p class="t0">Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Out of a house and so out of a farm</p>
<p class="t0">At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn</p>
<p class="t0">To earn a living on the Concord railroad,</p>
<p class="t0">As under-ticket-agent at a station</p>
<p class="t0">Where his job, when he wasn’t selling tickets,</p>
<p class="t0">Was setting out up track and down, not plants</p>
<p class="t0">As on a farm, but planets, evening stars</p>
<p class="t0">That varied in their hue from red to green.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He got a good glass for six hundred dollars.</p>
<p class="t0">His new job gave him leisure for star-gazing.</p>
<p class="t0">Often he bid me come and have a look</p>
<p class="t0">Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,</p>
<p class="t0">At a star quaking in the other end.</p>
<p class="t0">I recollect a night of broken clouds</p>
<p class="t0">And underfoot snow melted down to ice,</p>
<p class="t0">And melting further in the wind to mud.</p>
<p class="t0">Bradford and I had out the telescope.</p>
<p class="t0">We spread our two legs as we spread its three,</p>
<p class="t0">Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,</p>
<p class="t0">And standing at our leisure till the day broke,</p>
<p class="t0">Said some of the best things we ever said.<a class="fn" href="#fn_19" id="fr_19">[19]</a></p>
<p class="t0">That telescope was christened the Star-splitter,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p class="t0">Because it didn’t do a thing but split</p>
<p class="t0">A star in two or three the way you split</p>
<p class="t0">A globule of quicksilver in your hand</p>
<p class="t0">With one stroke of your finger in the middle.</p>
<p class="t0">It’s a star-splitter if there ever was one</p>
<p class="t0">And ought to do some good if splitting stars</p>
<p class="t0">’Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We’ve looked and looked, but after all where are we?</p>
<p class="t0">Do we know any better where we are,</p>
<p class="t0">And how it stands between the night to-night</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Her teacher’s certainty it must be Mabel</p>
<p class="t0">Made Maple first take notice of her name.</p>
<p class="t0">She asked her father and he told her “Maple—</p>
<p class="t0">Maple is right.”</p>
<p class="t6">“But teacher told the school</p>
<p class="t0">There’s no such name.”</p>
<p class="t9">“Teachers don’t know as much</p>
<p class="t0">As fathers about children, you tell teacher.</p>
<p class="t0">You tell her that it’s M-A-P-L-E.</p>
<p class="t0">You ask her if she knows a maple tree.</p>
<p class="t0">Well, you were named after a maple tree.</p>
<p class="t0">Your mother named you. You and she just saw</p>
<p class="t0">Each other in passing in the room upstairs,</p>
<p class="t0">One coming this way into life, and one</p>
<p class="t0">Going the other out of life—you know?</p>
<p class="t0">So you can’t have much recollection of her.</p>
<p class="t0">She had been having a long look at you.</p>
<p class="t0">She put her finger in your cheek so hard</p>
<p class="t0">It must have made your dimple there, and said,</p>
<p class="t0">‘Maple.’ I said it too: ‘Yes, for her name.’</p>
<p class="t0">She nodded. So we’re sure there’s no mistake.</p>
<p class="t0">I don’t know what she wanted it to mean,</p>
<p class="t0">But it seems like some word she left to bid you</p>
<p class="t0">Be a good girl—be like a maple tree.</p>
<p class="t0">How like a maple tree’s for us to guess.</p>
<p class="t0">Or for a little girl to guess sometime.</p>

<p class="t0">Dangerous self-arousing words to sow.</p>
<p class="t0">Luckily all she wanted of her name then</p>
<p class="t0">Was to rebuke her teacher with it next day,</p>
<p class="t0">And give the teacher a scare as from her father.</p>
<p class="t0">Anything further had been wasted on her,</p>
<p class="t0">Or so he tried to think to avoid blame.</p>
<p class="t0">She would forget it. She all but forgot it.</p>
<p class="t0">What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep,</p>
<p class="t0">And came so near death in the dark of years,</p>
<p class="t0">That when it woke and came to life again</p>
<p class="t0">The flower was different from the parent seed.</p>
<p class="t0">It came back vaguely at the glass one day,</p>
<p class="t0">As she stood saying her name over aloud,</p>
<p class="t0">Striking it gently across her lowered eyes</p>
<p class="t0">To make it go well with the way she looked.</p>
<p class="t0">What was it about her name? Its strangeness lay</p>
<p class="t0">In having too much meaning. Other names,</p>
<p class="t0">As Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie,</p>
<p class="t0">Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning,</p>
<p class="t0">But hadn’t as it went. (She knew a Rose.)</p>
<p class="t0">This difference from other names it was</p>
<p class="t0">Made people notice it—and notice her.</p>
<p class="t0">(They either noticed it, or got it wrong.)</p>
<p class="t0">Her problem was to find out what it asked</p>
<p class="t0">In dress or manner of the girl who bore it.</p>
<p class="t0">If she could form some notion of her mother—</p>
<p class="t0">What she had thought was lovely, and what good.</p>
<p class="t0">This was her mother’s childhood home;</p>
<p class="t0">The house one story high in front, three stories</p>
<p class="t0">On the end it presented to the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p class="t0">(The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar.)</p>
<p class="t0">Her mother’s bedroom was her father’s still,</p>
<p class="t0">Where she could watch her mother’s picture fading.</p>
<p class="t0">Once she found for a bookmark in the Bible</p>
<p class="t0">A maple leaf she thought must have been laid</p>
<p class="t0">In wait for her there. She read every word</p>
<p class="t0">Of the two pages it was pressed between</p>
<p class="t0">As if it was her mother speaking to her.</p>
<p class="t0">But forgot to put the leaf back in closing</p>
<p class="t0">And lost the place never to read again.</p>
<p class="t0">She was sure, though, there had been nothing in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So she looked for herself, as everyone</p>
<p class="t0">Looks for himself, more or less outwardly.</p>
<p class="t0">And her self-seeking, fitful though it was,</p>
<p class="t0">May still have been what led her on to read,</p>
<p class="t0">And think a little, and get some city schooling.</p>
<p class="t0">She learned shorthand, whatever shorthand may</p>
<p class="t0">Have had to do with it—she sometimes wondered.</p>
<p class="t0">So, till she found herself in a strange place</p>
<p class="t0">For the name Maple to have brought her to,</p>
<p class="t0">Taking dictation on a paper pad,</p>
<p class="t0">And in the pauses when she raised her eyes</p>
<p class="t0">Watching out of a nineteenth story window</p>
<p class="t0">An airship laboring with unship-like motion</p>
<p class="t0">And a vague all-disturbing roar above the river</p>
<p class="t0">Beyond the highest city built with hands.</p>
<p class="t0">Someone was saying in such natural tones</p>
<p class="t0">She almost wrote the words down on her knee,</p>
<p class="t0">“Do you know you remind me of a tree—</p>
<p class="t0">A maple tree?”</p>
<p class="t6">“Because my name is Maple?”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Isn’t it Mabel? I thought it was Mabel.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“No doubt you’ve heard the office call me Mabel.</p>
<p class="t0">I have to let them call me what they like.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">They were both stirred that he should have divined</p>
<p class="t0">Without the name her personal mystery.</p>
<p class="t0">It made it seem as if there must be something</p>
<p class="t0">She must have missed herself. So they were married,</p>
<p class="t0">And took the fancy home with them to live by.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">They went on pilgrimage once to her father’s</p>
<p class="t0">(The house one story high in front, three stories</p>
<p class="t0">On the side it presented to the road)</p>
<p class="t0">To see if there was not some special tree</p>
<p class="t0">She might have overlooked. They could find none,</p>
<p class="t0">Not so much as a single tree for shade,</p>
<p class="t0">Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard.</p>
<p class="t0">She told him of the bookmark maple leaf</p>
<p class="t0">In the big Bible, and all she remembered</p>
<p class="t0">Of the place marked with it—“Wave offering,</p>
<p class="t0">Something about wave offering, it said.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“You’ve never asked your father outright, have you?”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“I have, and been put off sometime, I think.”</p>
<p class="t0">(This was her faded memory of the way</p>
<p class="t0">Once long ago her father had put himself off.)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Because no telling but it may have been</p>
<p class="t0">Something between your father and your mother</p>
<p class="t0">Not meant for us at all.”</p>
<p class="t10">“Not meant for me?</p>
<p class="t0">Where would the fairness be in giving me</p>
<p class="t0">A name to carry for life, and never know</p>
<p class="t0">The secret of?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p class="t6">“And then it may have been</p>
<p class="t0">Something a father couldn’t tell a daughter</p>
<p class="t0">As well as could a mother. And again</p>
<p class="t0">It may have been their one lapse into fancy</p>
<p class="t0">’Twould be too bad to make him sorry for</p>
<p class="t0">By bringing it up to him when he was too old.</p>
<p class="t0">Your father feels us round him with our questing,</p>
<p class="t0">And holds us off unnecessarily,</p>
<p class="t0">As if he didn’t know what little thing</p>
<p class="t0">Might lead us on to a discovery.</p>
<p class="t0">It was as personal as he could be</p>
<p class="t0">About the way he saw it was with you</p>
<p class="t0">To say your mother, had she lived, would be</p>
<p class="t0">As far again as from being born to bearing.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Just one look more with what you say in mind,</p>
<p class="t0">And I give up”; which last look came to nothing.</p>
<p class="t0">But, though they now gave up the search forever,</p>
<p class="t0">They clung to what one had seen in the other</p>
<p class="t0">By inspiration. It proved there was something.</p>
<p class="t0">They kept their thoughts away from when the maples</p>
<p class="t0">Stood uniform in buckets, and the steam</p>
<p class="t0">Of sap and snow rolled off the sugar house.</p>
<p class="t0">When they made her related to the maples,</p>
<p class="t0">It was the tree the autumn fire ran through</p>
<p class="t0">And swept of leathern leaves, but left the bark</p>
<p class="t0">Unscorched, unblackened, even, by any smoke.</p>
<p class="t0">They always took their holidays in autumn.</p>
<p class="t0">Once they came on a maple in a glade,</p>
<p class="t0">Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up,</p>
<p class="t0">And every leaf of foliage she’d worn</p>
<p class="t0">Laid scarlet and pale pink about her feet.</p>
<p class="t0">But its age kept them from considering this one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p class="t0">Twenty-five years ago at Maple’s naming</p>
<p class="t0">It hardly could have been a two-leaved seedling</p>
<p class="t0">The next cow might have licked up out at pasture.</p>
<p class="t0">Could it have been another maple like it?</p>
<p class="t0">They hovered for a moment near discovery,</p>
<p class="t0">Figurative enough to see the symbol,</p>
<p class="t0">But lacking faith in anything to mean</p>
<p class="t0">The same at different times to different people.</p>
<p class="t0">Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept them</p>
<p class="t0">From thinking it could be a thing so bridal.</p>
<p class="t0">And anyway it came too late for Maple.</p>
<p class="t0">She used her hands to cover up her eyes.</p>
<p class="t0">“We would not see the secret if we could now:</p>
<p class="t0">We are not looking for it any more.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thus had a name with meaning, given in death,</p>
<p class="t0">Made a girl’s marriage, and ruled in her life.</p>
<p class="t0">No matter that the meaning was not clear.</p>
<p class="t0">A name with meaning could bring up a child,</p>
<p class="t0">Taking the child out of the parents’ hands.</p>
<p class="t0">Better a meaningless name, I should say,</p>
<p class="t0">As leaving more to nature and happy chance.</p>
<p class="t0">Name children some names and see what you do.</p>

<h2 id="ch6">THE AXE-HELVE</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I’ve known ere now an interfering branch</p>
<p class="t0">Of alder catch my lifted axe behind me.</p>
<p class="t0">But that was in the woods, to hold my hand</p>
<p class="t0">From striking at another alder’s roots,</p>
<p class="t0">And that was, as I say, an alder branch.</p>
<p class="t0">This was a man, Baptiste, who stole one day</p>
<p class="t0">Behind me on the snow in my own yard</p>
<p class="t0">Where I was working at the chopping-block,</p>
<p class="t0">And cutting nothing not cut down already.</p>
<p class="t0">He caught my axe expertly on the rise,</p>
<p class="t0">When all my strength put forth was in his favor,</p>
<p class="t0">Held it a moment where it was, to calm me,</p>
<p class="t0">Then took it from me—and I let him take it.</p>
<p class="t0">I didn’t know him well enough to know</p>
<p class="t0">What it was all about. There might be something</p>
<p class="t0">He had in mind to say to a bad neighbor</p>
<p class="t0">He might prefer to say to him disarmed.</p>
<p class="t0">But all he had to tell me in French-English</p>
<p class="t0">Was what he thought of—not me, but my axe;</p>
<p class="t0">Me only as I took my axe to heart.</p>
<p class="t0">It was the bad axe-helve some one had sold me—</p>
<p class="t0">“Made on machine,” he said, ploughing the grain</p>
<p class="t0">With a thick thumbnail to show how it ran</p>
<p class="t0">Across the handle’s long drawn serpentine,</p>
<p class="t0">Like the two strokes across a dollar sign.</p>
<p class="t0">“You give her one good crack, she’s snap raght off.</p>
<p class="t0">Den where’s your hax-ead flying t’rough de hair?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p class="t0">Admitted; and yet, what was that to him?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Come on my house and I put you one in</p>
<p class="t0">What’s las’ awhile—good hick’ry what’s grow crooked,</p>
<p class="t0">De second growt’ I cut myself—tough, tough!”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Something to sell? That wasn’t how it sounded.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Den when you say you come? It’s cost you nothing.</p>
<p class="t0">To-naght?”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t5">As well to-night as any night.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Beyond an over-warmth of kitchen stove</p>
<p class="t0">My welcome differed from no other welcome.</p>
<p class="t0">Baptiste knew best why I was where I was.</p>
<p class="t0">So long as he would leave enough unsaid,</p>
<p class="t0">I shouldn’t mind his being overjoyed</p>
<p class="t0">(If overjoyed he was) at having got me</p>
<p class="t0">Where I must judge if what he knew about an axe</p>
<p class="t0">That not everybody else knew was to count</p>
<p class="t0">For nothing in the measure of a neighbor.</p>
<p class="t0">Hard if, though cast away for life with Yankees,</p>
<p class="t0">A Frenchman couldn’t get his human rating!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Mrs. Baptiste came in and rocked a chair</p>
<p class="t0">That had as many motions as the world:</p>
<p class="t0">One back and forward, in and out of shadow,</p>
<p class="t0">That got her nowhere; one more gradual,</p>
<p class="t0">Sideways, that would have run her on the stove</p>
<p class="t0">In time, had she not realized her danger</p>
<p class="t0">And caught herself up bodily, chair and all,</p>
<p class="t0">And set herself back where she started from.</p>
<p class="t0">“She ain’t spick too much Henglish—dat’s too bad.”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I was afraid, in brightening first on me,</p>
<p class="t0">Then on Baptiste, as if she understood</p>
<p class="t0">What passed between us, she was only feigning.</p>
<p class="t0">Baptiste was anxious for her; but no more</p>
<p class="t0">Than for himself, so placed he couldn’t hope</p>
<p class="t0">To keep his bargain of the morning with me</p>
<p class="t0">In time to keep me from suspecting him</p>
<p class="t0">Of really never having meant to keep it.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Needlessly soon he had his axe-helves out,</p>
<p class="t0">A quiverful to choose from, since he wished me</p>
<p class="t0">To have the best he had, or had to spare—</p>
<p class="t0">Not for me to ask which, when what he took</p>
<p class="t0">Had beauties he had to point me out at length</p>
<p class="t0">To insure their not being wasted on me.</p>
<p class="t0">He liked to have it slender as a whipstock,</p>
<p class="t0">Free from the least knot, equal to the strain</p>
<p class="t0">Of bending like a sword across the knee.</p>
<p class="t0">He showed me that the lines of a good helve</p>
<p class="t0">Were native to the grain before the knife</p>
<p class="t0">Expressed them, and its curves were no false curves</p>
<p class="t0">Put on it from without. And there its strength lay</p>
<p class="t0">For the hard work. He chafed its long white body</p>
<p class="t0">From end to end with his rough hand shut round it.</p>
<p class="t0">He tried it at the eye-hole in the axe-head.</p>
<p class="t0">“Hahn, hahn,” he mused, “don’t need much taking down.”</p>
<p class="t0">Baptiste knew how to make a short job long</p>
<p class="t0">For love of it, and yet not waste time either.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Do you know, what we talked about was knowledge?</p>
<p class="t0">Baptiste on his defence about the children</p>
<p class="t0">He kept from school, or did his best to keep—</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p class="t0">Whatever school and children and our doubts</p>
<p class="t0">Of laid-on education had to do</p>
<p class="t0">With the curves of his axe-helves and his having</p>
<p class="t0">Used these unscrupulously to bring me</p>
<p class="t0">To see for once the inside of his house.</p>
<p class="t0">Was I desired in friendship, partly as some one</p>
<p class="t0">To leave it to, whether the right to hold</p>
<p class="t0">Such doubts of education should depend</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the education of those who held them?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But now he brushed the shavings from his knee</p>
<p class="t0">And stood the axe there on its horse’s hoof,</p>
<p class="t0">Erect, but not without its waves, as when</p>
<p class="t0">The snake stood up for evil in the Garden,—</p>
<p class="t0">Top-heavy with a heaviness his short,</p>
<p class="t0">Thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down</p>
<p class="t0">And in a little—a French touch in that.</p>
<p class="t0">Baptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased;</p>
<p class="t0">“See how she’s cock her head!”</p>

<h2 id="ch7">THE GRINDSTONE</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Having a wheel and four legs of its own</p>
<p class="t0">Has never availed the cumbersome grindstone</p>
<p class="t0">To get it anywhere that I can see.</p>
<p class="t0">These hands have helped it go, and even race;</p>
<p class="t0">Not all the motion, though, they ever lent,</p>
<p class="t0">Not all the miles it may have thought it went,</p>
<p class="t0">Have got it one step from the starting place.</p>
<p class="t0">It stands beside the same old apple tree.</p>
<p class="t0">The shadow of the apple tree is thin</p>
<p class="t0">Upon it now, its feet are fast in snow.</p>
<p class="t0">All other farm machinery’s gone in,</p>
<p class="t0">And some of it on no more legs and wheel</p>
<p class="t0">Than the grindstone can boast to stand or go.</p>
<p class="t0">(I’m thinking chiefly of the wheelbarrow.)</p>
<p class="t0">For months it hasn’t known the taste of steel,</p>
<p class="t0">Washed down with rusty water in a tin.</p>
<p class="t0">But standing outdoors hungry, in the cold,</p>
<p class="t0">Except in towns at night, is not a sin.</p>
<p class="t0">And, anyway, its standing in the yard</p>
<p class="t0">Under a ruinous live apple tree</p>
<p class="t0">Has nothing any more to do with me,</p>
<p class="t0">Except that I remember how of old</p>
<p class="t0">One summer day, all day I drove it hard,</p>
<p class="t0">And someone mounted on it rode it hard,</p>
<p class="t0">And he and I between us ground a blade.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I gave it the preliminary spin,</p>
<p class="t0">And poured on water (tears it might have been);</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p class="t0">And when it almost gayly jumped and flowed,</p>
<p class="t0">A Father-Time-like man got on and rode,</p>
<p class="t0">Armed with a scythe and spectacles that glowed.</p>
<p class="t0">He turned on will-power to increase the load</p>
<p class="t0">And slow me down—and I abruptly slowed,</p>
<p class="t0">Like coming to a sudden railroad station.</p>
<p class="t0">I changed from hand to hand in desperation.</p>
<p class="t0">I wondered what machine of ages gone</p>
<p class="t0">This represented an improvement on.</p>
<p class="t0">For all I knew it may have sharpened spears</p>
<p class="t0">And arrowheads itself. Much use for years</p>
<p class="t0">Had gradually worn it an oblate</p>
<p class="t0">Spheroid that kicked and struggled in its gait,</p>
<p class="t0">Appearing to return me hate for hate;</p>
<p class="t0">(But I forgive it now as easily</p>
<p class="t0">As any other boyhood enemy</p>
<p class="t0">Whose pride has failed to get him anywhere).</p>
<p class="t0">I wondered who it was the man thought ground—</p>
<p class="t0">The one who held the wheel back or the one</p>
<p class="t0">Who gave his life to keep it going round?</p>
<p class="t0">I wondered if he really thought it fair</p>
<p class="t0">For him to have the say when we were done.</p>
<p class="t0">Such were the bitter thoughts to which I turned.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Not for myself was I so much concerned.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh no!—although, of course, I could have found</p>
<p class="t0">A better way to pass the afternoon</p>
<p class="t0">Than grinding discord out of a grindstone,</p>
<p class="t0">And beating insects at their gritty tune.</p>
<p class="t0">Nor was I for the man so much concerned.</p>
<p class="t0">Once when the grindstone almost jumped its bearing</p>
<p class="t0">It looked as if he might be badly thrown</p>
<p class="t0">And wounded on his blade. So far from caring,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p class="t0">I laughed inside, and only cranked the faster,</p>
<p class="t0">(It ran as if it wasn’t greased but glued);</p>
<p class="t0">I’d welcome any moderate disaster</p>
<p class="t0">That might be calculated to postpone</p>
<p class="t0">What evidently nothing could conclude.</p>
<p class="t0">The thing that made me more and more afraid</p>
<p class="t0">Was that we’d ground it sharp and hadn’t known,</p>
<p class="t0">And now were only wasting precious blade.</p>
<p class="t0">And when he raised it dripping once and tried</p>
<p class="t0">The creepy edge of it with wary touch,</p>
<p class="t0">And viewed it over his glasses funny-eyed,</p>
<p class="t0">Only disinterestedly to decide</p>
<p class="t0">It needed a turn more, I could have cried</p>
<p class="t0">Wasn’t there danger of a turn too much?</p>
<p class="t0">Mightn’t we make it worse instead of better?</p>
<p class="t0">I was for leaving something to the whetter.</p>
<p class="t0">What if it wasn’t all it should be? I’d</p>
<p class="t0">Be satisfied if he’d be satisfied.</p>

<h2 id="ch8">PAUL’S WIFE</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To drive Paul out of any lumber camp</p>
<p class="t0">All that was needed was to say to him,</p>
<p class="t0">“How is the wife, Paul?”—and he’d disappear.</p>
<p class="t0">Some said it was because he had no wife,</p>
<p class="t0">And hated to be twitted on the subject.</p>
<p class="t0">Others because he’d come within a day</p>
<p class="t0">Or so of having one, and then been jilted.</p>
<p class="t0">Others because he’d had one once, a good one,</p>
<p class="t0">Who’d run away with some one else and left him.</p>
<p class="t0">And others still because he had one now</p>
<p class="t0">He only had to be reminded of,—</p>
<p class="t0">He was all duty to her in a minute:</p>
<p class="t0">He had to run right off to look her up,</p>
<p class="t0">As if to say, “That’s so, how is my wife?</p>
<p class="t0">I hope she isn’t getting into mischief.”</p>
<p class="t0">No one was anxious to get rid of Paul.</p>
<p class="t0">He’d been the hero of the mountain camps</p>
<p class="t0">Ever since, just to show them, he had slipped</p>
<p class="t0">The bark of a whole tamarack off whole,</p>
<p class="t0">As clean as boys do off a willow twig</p>
<p class="t0">To make a willow whistle on a Sunday</p>
<p class="t0">In April by subsiding meadow brooks.</p>
<p class="t0">They seemed to ask him just to see him go,</p>
<p class="t0">“How is the wife, Paul?” and he always went.</p>
<p class="t0">He never stopped to murder anyone</p>
<p class="t0">Who asked the question. He just disappeared—</p>
<p class="t0">Nobody knew in what direction,</p>
<p class="t0">Although it wasn’t usually long</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p class="t0">Before they heard of him in some new camp,</p>
<p class="t0">The same Paul at the same old feats of logging.</p>
<p class="t0">The question everywhere was why should Paul</p>
<p class="t0">Object to being asked a civil question—</p>
<p class="t0">A man you could say almost anything to</p>
<p class="t0">Short of a fighting word. You have the answers.</p>
<p class="t0">And there was one more not so fair to Paul:</p>
<p class="t0">That Paul had married a wife not his equal.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul was ashamed of her. To match a hero,</p>
<p class="t0">She would have had to be a heroine;</p>
<p class="t0">Instead of which she was some half-breed squaw.</p>
<p class="t0">But if the story Murphy told was true,</p>
<p class="t0">She wasn’t anything to be ashamed of.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">You know Paul could do wonders. Everyone’s</p>
<p class="t0">Heard how he thrashed the horses on a load</p>
<p class="t0">That wouldn’t budge until they simply stretched</p>
<p class="t0">Their rawhide harness from the load to camp.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul told the boss the load would be all right,</p>
<p class="t0">“The sun will bring your load in”—and it did—</p>
<p class="t0">By shrinking the rawhide to natural length.</p>
<p class="t0">That’s what is called a stretcher. But I guess</p>
<p class="t0">The one about his jumping so’s to land</p>
<p class="t0">With both his feet at once against the ceiling,</p>
<p class="t0">And then land safely right side up again,</p>
<p class="t0">Back on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact.</p>
<p class="t0">Well this is such a yarn. Paul sawed his wife</p>
<p class="t0">Out of a white-pine log. Murphy was there,</p>
<p class="t0">And, as you might say, saw the lady born.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul worked at anything in lumbering.</p>
<p class="t0">He’d been hard at it taking boards away</p>
<p class="t0">For—I forget—the last ambitious sawyer</p>
<p class="t0">To want to find out if he couldn’t pile</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p class="t0">The lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy.</p>
<p class="t0">They’d sliced the first slab off a big butt log,</p>
<p class="t0">And the sawyer had slammed the carriage back</p>
<p class="t0">To slam end on again against the saw teeth.</p>
<p class="t0">To judge them by the way they caught themselves</p>
<p class="t0">When they saw what had happened to the log,</p>
<p class="t0">They must have had a guilty expectation</p>
<p class="t0">Something was going to go with their slambanging.</p>
<p class="t0">Something had left a broad black streak of grease</p>
<p class="t0">On the new wood the whole length of the log</p>
<p class="t0">Except, perhaps, a foot at either end.</p>
<p class="t0">But when Paul put his finger in the grease,</p>
<p class="t0">It wasn’t grease at all, but a long slot.</p>
<p class="t0">The log was hollow. They were sawing pine.</p>
<p class="t0">“First time I ever saw a hollow pine.</p>
<p class="t0">That comes of having Paul around the place.</p>
<p class="t0">Take it to hell for me,” the sawyer said.</p>
<p class="t0">Everyone had to have a look at it,</p>
<p class="t0">And tell Paul what he ought to do about it.</p>
<p class="t0">(They treated it as his.) “You take a jack-knife,</p>
<p class="t0">And spread the opening, and you’ve got a dug-out</p>
<p class="t0">All dug to go a-fishing in.” To Paul</p>
<p class="t0">The hollow looked too sound and clean and empty</p>
<p class="t0">Ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees.</p>
<p class="t0">There was no entrance for them to get in by.</p>
<p class="t0">It looked to him like some new kind of hollow</p>
<p class="t0">He thought he’d <i>better</i> take his jack-knife to.</p>
<p class="t0">So after work that evening he came back</p>
<p class="t0">And let enough light into it by cutting</p>
<p class="t0">To see if it was empty. He made out in there</p>
<p class="t0">A slender length of pith, or was it pith?</p>
<p class="t0">It might have been the skin a snake had cast</p>
<p class="t0">And left stood up on end inside the tree</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p class="t0">The hundred years the tree must have been growing.</p>
<p class="t0">More cutting and he had this in both hands,</p>
<p class="t0">And, looking from it to the pond near by,</p>
<p class="t0">Paul wondered how it would respond to water.</p>
<p class="t0">Not a breeze stirred, but just the breath of air</p>
<p class="t0">He made in walking slowly to the beach</p>
<p class="t0">Blew it once off his hands and almost broke it.</p>
<p class="t0">He laid it at the edge where it could drink.</p>
<p class="t0">At the first drink it rustled and grew limp.</p>
<p class="t0">At the next drink it grew invisible.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers,</p>
<p class="t0">And thought it must have melted. It was gone.</p>
<p class="t0">And then beyond the open water, dim with midges,</p>
<p class="t0">Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom,</p>
<p class="t0">It slowly rose a person, rose a girl,</p>
<p class="t0">Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet,</p>
<p class="t0">Who, leaning on a log looked back at Paul.</p>
<p class="t0">And that made Paul in turn look back</p>
<p class="t0">To see if it was anyone behind him</p>
<p class="t0">That she was looking at instead of him.</p>
<p class="t0">Murphy had been there watching all the time,</p>
<p class="t0">But from a shed where neither of them could see him.</p>
<p class="t0">There was a moment of suspense in birth</p>
<p class="t0">When the girl seemed too water-logged to live,</p>
<p class="t0">Before she caught her first breath with a gasp</p>
<p class="t0">And laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet,</p>
<p class="t0">And walked off talking to herself or Paul</p>
<p class="t0">Across the logs like backs of alligators,</p>
<p class="t0">Paul taking after her around the pond.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Next evening Murphy and some other fellows</p>
<p class="t0">Got drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount,</p>
<p class="t0">From the bare top of which there is a view</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p class="t0">To other hills across a kettle valley.</p>
<p class="t0">And there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it,</p>
<p class="t0">They saw Paul and his creature keeping house.</p>
<p class="t0">It was the only glimpse that anyone</p>
<p class="t0">Has had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them</p>
<p class="t0">Falling in love across the twilight mill-pond.</p>
<p class="t0">More than a mile across the wilderness</p>
<p class="t0">They sat together half-way up a cliff</p>
<p class="t0">In a small niche let into it, the girl</p>
<p class="t0">Brightly, as if a star played on the place,</p>
<p class="t0">Paul darkly, like her shadow. All the light</p>
<p class="t0">Was from the girl herself, though, not from a star,</p>
<p class="t0">As was apparent from what happened next.</p>
<p class="t0">All those great ruffians put their throats together,</p>
<p class="t0">And let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle,</p>
<p class="t0">As a brute tribute of respect to beauty.</p>
<p class="t0">Of course the bottle fell short by a mile,</p>
<p class="t0">But the shout reached the girl and put her light out.</p>
<p class="t0">She went out like a firefly, and that was all.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So there were witnesses that Paul was married,</p>
<p class="t0">And not to anyone to be ashamed of.</p>
<p class="t0">Everyone had been wrong in judging Paul.</p>
<p class="t0">Murphy told me Paul put on all those airs</p>
<p class="t0">About his wife to keep her to himself.</p>
<p class="t0">Paul was what’s called a terrible possessor.</p>
<p class="t0">Owning a wife with him meant owning her.</p>
<p class="t0">She wasn’t anybody else’s business,</p>
<p class="t0">Either to praise her, or so much as name her,</p>
<p class="t0">And he’d thank people not to think of her.</p>
<p class="t0">Murphy’s idea was that a man like Paul</p>
<p class="t0">Wouldn’t be spoken to about a wife</p>
<p class="t0">In any way the world knew how to speak.</p>

<h2 id="ch9">WILD GRAPES</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What tree may not the fig be gathered from?</p>
<p class="t0">The grape may not be gathered from the birch?</p>
<p class="t0">It’s all you know the grape, or know the birch.</p>
<p class="t0">As a girl gathered from the birch myself</p>
<p class="t0">Equally with my weight in grapes, one autumn,</p>
<p class="t0">I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of.</p>
<p class="t0">I was born, I suppose, like anyone,</p>
<p class="t0">And grew to be a little boyish girl</p>
<p class="t0">My brother could not always leave at home.</p>
<p class="t0">But that beginning was wiped out in fear</p>
<p class="t0">The day I swung suspended with the grapes,</p>
<p class="t0">And was come after like Eurydice</p>
<p class="t0">And brought down safely from the upper regions;</p>
<p class="t0">And the life I live now’s an extra life</p>
<p class="t0">I can waste as I please on whom I please.</p>
<p class="t0">So if you see me celebrate two birthdays,</p>
<p class="t0">And give myself out as two different ages,</p>
<p class="t0">One of them five years younger than I look—</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">One day my brother led me to a glade</p>
<p class="t0">Where a white birch he knew of stood alone,</p>
<p class="t0">Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves,</p>
<p class="t0">And heavy on her heavy hair behind,</p>
<p class="t0">Against her neck, an ornament of grapes.</p>
<p class="t0">Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last year.</p>
<p class="t0">One bunch of them, and there began to be</p>
<p class="t0">Bunches all round me growing in white birches,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p class="t0">The way they grew round Lief the Lucky’s German;</p>
<p class="t0">Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though,</p>
<p class="t0">As the moon used to seem when I was younger,</p>
<p class="t0">And only freely to be had for climbing.</p>
<p class="t0">My brother did the climbing; and at first</p>
<p class="t0">Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter</p>
<p class="t0">And have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack;</p>
<p class="t0">Which gave him some time to himself to eat,</p>
<p class="t0">But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed.</p>
<p class="t0">So then, to make me wholly self-supporting,</p>
<p class="t0">He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth,</p>
<p class="t0">And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes.</p>
<p class="t0">“Here, take a tree-top, I’ll get down another.</p>
<p class="t0">Hold on with all your might when I let go.”</p>
<p class="t0">I said I had the tree. It wasn’t true.</p>
<p class="t0">The opposite was true. The tree had me.</p>
<p class="t0">The minute it was left with me alone</p>
<p class="t0">It caught me up as if I were the fish</p>
<p class="t0">And it the fishpole. So I was translated</p>
<p class="t0">To loud cries from my brother of “Let go!</p>
<p class="t0">Don’t you know anything, you girl? Let go!”</p>
<p class="t0">But I, with something of the baby grip</p>
<p class="t0">Acquired ancestrally in just such trees</p>
<p class="t0">When wilder mothers than our wildest now</p>
<p class="t0">Hung babies out on branches by the hands</p>
<p class="t0">To dry or wash or tan, I don’t know which</p>
<p class="t0">(You’ll have to ask an evolutionist)—</p>
<p class="t0">I held on uncomplainingly for life.</p>
<p class="t0">My brother tried to make me laugh to help me.</p>
<p class="t0">“What are you doing up there in those grapes?</p>
<p class="t0">Don’t be afraid. A few of them won’t hurt you.</p>
<p class="t0">I mean, they won’t pick you if you don’t them.”</p>
<p class="t0">Much danger of my picking anything!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">By that time I was pretty well reduced</p>
<p class="t0">To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.</p>
<p class="t0">“Now you know how it feels,” my brother said,</p>
<p class="t0">“To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,</p>
<p class="t0">That when it thinks it has escaped the fox</p>
<p class="t0">By growing where it shouldn’t—on a birch,</p>
<p class="t0">Where a fox wouldn’t think to look for it—</p>
<p class="t0">And if he looked and found it, couldn’t reach it—</p>
<p class="t0">Just then come you and I to gather it.</p>
<p class="t0">Only you have the advantage of the grapes</p>
<p class="t0">In one way: you have one more stem to cling by,</p>
<p class="t0">And promise more resistance to the picker.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">One by one I lost off my hat and shoes,</p>
<p class="t0">And still I clung. I let my head fall back,</p>
<p class="t0">And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears</p>
<p class="t0">Against my brother’s nonsense; “Drop,” he said,</p>
<p class="t0">“I’ll catch you in my arms. It isn’t far.”</p>
<p class="t0">(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)</p>
<p class="t0">“Drop or I’ll shake the tree and shake you down.”</p>
<p class="t0">Grim silence on my part as I sank lower,</p>
<p class="t0">My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings.</p>
<p class="t0">“Why, if she isn’t serious about it!</p>
<p class="t0">Hold tight awhile till I think what to do.</p>
<p class="t0">I’ll bend the tree down and let you down by it.”</p>
<p class="t0">I don’t know much about the letting down;</p>
<p class="t0">But once I felt ground with my stocking feet</p>
<p class="t0">And the world came revolving back to me,</p>
<p class="t0">I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers,</p>
<p class="t0">Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off.</p>
<p class="t0">My brother said: “Don’t you weigh anything?</p>
<p class="t0">Try to weigh something next time, so you won’t</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p class="t0">Be run off with by birch trees into space.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It wasn’t my not weighing anything</p>
<p class="t0">So much as my not knowing anything—</p>
<p class="t0">My brother had been nearer right before.</p>
<p class="t0">I had not taken the first step in knowledge;</p>
<p class="t0">I had not learned to let go with the hands,</p>
<p class="t0">As still I have not learned to with the heart,</p>
<p class="t0">And have no wish to with the heart—nor need,</p>
<p class="t0">That I can see. The mind—is not the heart.</p>
<p class="t0">I may yet live, as I know others live,</p>
<p class="t0">To wish in vain to let go with the mind—</p>
<p class="t0">Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells me</p>
<p class="t0">That I need learn to let go with the heart.</p>

<h2 id="ch10">PLACE FOR A THIRD</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nothing to say to all those marriages!</p>
<p class="t0">She had made three herself to three of his.</p>
<p class="t0">The score was even for them, three to three.</p>
<p class="t0">But come to die she found she cared so much:</p>
<p class="t0">She thought of children in a burial row;</p>
<p class="t0">Three children in a burial row were sad.</p>
<p class="t0">One man’s three women in a burial row</p>
<p class="t0">Somehow made her impatient with the man.</p>
<p class="t0">And so she said to Laban, “You have done</p>
<p class="t0">A good deal right; don’t do the last thing wrong.</p>
<p class="t0">Don’t make me lie with those two other women.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Laban said, No, he would not make her lie</p>
<p class="t0">With anyone but that she had a mind to,</p>
<p class="t0">If that was how she felt, of course, he said.</p>
<p class="t0">She went her way. But Laban having caught</p>
<p class="t0">This glimpse of lingering person in Eliza,</p>
<p class="t0">And anxious to make all he could of it</p>
<p class="t0">With something he remembered in himself,</p>
<p class="t0">Tried to think how he could exceed his promise,</p>
<p class="t0">And give good measure to the dead, though thankless.</p>
<p class="t0">If that was how she felt, he kept repeating.</p>
<p class="t0">His first thought under pressure was a grave</p>
<p class="t0">In a new boughten grave plot by herself,</p>
<p class="t0">Under he didn’t care how great a stone:</p>
<p class="t0">He’d sell a yoke of steers to pay for it.</p>
<p class="t0">And weren’t there special cemetery flowers,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p class="t0">That, once grief sets to growing, grief may rest:</p>
<p class="t0">The flowers will go on with grief awhile,</p>
<p class="t0">And no one seem neglecting or neglected?</p>
<p class="t0">A prudent grief will not despise such aids.</p>
<p class="t0">He thought of evergreen and everlasting.</p>
<p class="t0">And then he had a thought worth many of these.</p>
<p class="t0">Somewhere must be the grave of the young boy</p>
<p class="t0">Who married her for playmate more than helpmate,</p>
<p class="t0">And sometimes laughed at what it was between them.</p>
<p class="t0">How would she like to sleep her last with him?</p>
<p class="t0">Where was his grave? Did Laban know his name?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He found the grave a town or two away,</p>
<p class="t0">The headstone cut with <i>John, Beloved Husband</i>,</p>
<p class="t0">Beside it room reserved, the say a sister’s,</p>
<p class="t0">A never-married sister’s of that husband,</p>
<p class="t0">Whether Eliza would be welcome there.</p>
<p class="t0">The dead was bound to silence: ask the sister.</p>
<p class="t0">So Laban saw the sister, and, saying nothing</p>
<p class="t0">Of where Eliza wanted <i>not</i> to lie,</p>
<p class="t0">And who had thought to lay her with her first love,</p>
<p class="t0">Begged simply for the grave. The sister’s face</p>
<p class="t0">Fell all in wrinkles of responsibility.</p>
<p class="t0">She wanted to do right. She’d have to think.</p>
<p class="t0">Laban was old and poor, yet seemed to care;</p>
<p class="t0">And she was old and poor—but she cared, too.</p>
<p class="t0">They sat. She cast one dull, old look at him,</p>
<p class="t0">Then turned him out to go on other errands</p>
<p class="t0">She said he might attend to in the village,</p>
<p class="t0">While she made up her mind how much she cared—</p>
<p class="t0">And how much Laban cared—and why he cared,</p>
<p class="t0">(She made shrewd eyes to see where he came in.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p class="t0">She’d looked Eliza up her second time,</p>
<p class="t0">A widow at her second husband’s grave,</p>
<p class="t0">And offered her a home to rest awhile</p>
<p class="t0">Before she went the poor man’s widow’s way,</p>
<p class="t0">Housekeeping for the next man out of wedlock.</p>
<p class="t0">She and Eliza had been friends through all.</p>
<p class="t0">Who was she to judge marriage in a world</p>
<p class="t0">Whose Bible’s so confused in marriage counsel?</p>
<p class="t0">The sister had not come across this Laban;</p>
<p class="t0">A decent product of life’s ironing-out;</p>
<p class="t0">She must not keep him waiting. Time would press</p>
<p class="t0">Between the death day and the funeral day.</p>
<p class="t0">So when she saw him coming in the street</p>
<p class="t0">She hurried her decision to be ready</p>
<p class="t0">To meet him with his answer at the door.</p>
<p class="t0">Laban had known about what it would be</p>
<p class="t0">From the way she had set her poor old mouth,</p>
<p class="t0">To do, as she had put it, what was right.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She gave it through the screen door closed between them:</p>
<p class="t0">“No, not with John. There wouldn’t be no sense.</p>
<p class="t0">Eliza’s had too many other men.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Laban was forced to fall back on his plan</p>
<p class="t0">To buy Eliza a plot to lie alone in:</p>
<p class="t0">Which gives him for himself a choice of lots</p>
<p class="t0">When his time comes to die and settle down.</p>

<p class="t0">I went to sleep before I went to bed,</p>
<p class="t0">Especially in winter when the bed</p>
<p class="t0">Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow.</p>
<p class="t0">The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs</p>
<p class="t0">Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me,</p>
<p class="t0">But left an open door to cool the room off</p>
<p class="t0">So as to sort of turn me out of it.</p>
<p class="t0">I was just coming to myself enough</p>
<p class="t0">To wonder where the cold was coming from,</p>
<p class="t0">When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom</p>
<p class="t0">And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p class="t0">The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on</p>
<p class="t0">When there was water in the cellar in spring</p>
<p class="t0">Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone</p>
<p class="t0">Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step,</p>
<p class="t0">The way a man with one leg and a crutch,</p>
<p class="t0">Or a little child, comes up. It wasn’t Toffile:</p>
<p class="t0">It wasn’t anyone who could be there.</p>
<p class="t0">The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked</p>
<p class="t0">And swollen tight and buried under snow.</p>
<p class="t0">The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust</p>
<p class="t0">And swollen tight and buried under snow.</p>
<p class="t0">It was the bones. I knew them—and good reason.</p>
<p class="t0">My first impulse was to get to the knob</p>
<p class="t0">And hold the door. But the bones didn’t try</p>
<p class="t0">The door; they halted helpless on the landing,</p>
<p class="t0">Waiting for things to happen in their favor.</p>
<p class="t0">The faintest restless rustling ran all through them.</p>
<p class="t0">I never could have done the thing I did</p>
<p class="t0">If the wish hadn’t been too strong in me</p>
<p class="t0">To see how they were mounted for this walk.</p>
<p class="t0">I had a vision of them put together</p>
<p class="t0">Not like a man, but like a chandelier.</p>
<p class="t0">So suddenly I flung the door wide on him.</p>
<p class="t0">A moment he stood balancing with emotion,</p>
<p class="t0">And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire</p>
<p class="t0">Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth.</p>
<p class="t0">Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)</p>
<p class="t0">Then he came at me with one hand outstretched,</p>
<p class="t0">The way he did in life once; but this time</p>
<p class="t0">I struck the hand off brittle on the floor,</p>
<p class="t0">And fell back from him on the floor myself.</p>
<p class="t0">The finger-pieces slid in all directions.</p>
<p class="t0">(Where did I see one of those pieces lately?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p class="t0">Hand me my button-box—it must be there.)</p>
<p class="t0">I sat up on the floor and shouted, “Toffile,</p>
<p class="t0">It’s coming up to you.” It had its choice</p>
<p class="t0">Of the door to the cellar or the hall.</p>
<p class="t0">It took the hall door for the novelty,</p>
<p class="t0">And set off briskly for so slow a thing,</p>
<p class="t0">Still going every which way in the joints, though,</p>
<p class="t0">So that it looked like lightning or a scribble,</p>
<p class="t0">From the slap I had just now given its hand.</p>
<p class="t0">I listened till it almost climbed the stairs</p>
<p class="t0">From the hall to the only finished bedroom,</p>
<p class="t0">Before I got up to do anything;</p>
<p class="t0">Then ran and shouted, “Shut the bedroom door,</p>
<p class="t0">Toffile, for my sake!” “Company,” he said,</p>
<p class="t0">“Don’t make me get up; I’m too warm in bed.”</p>
<p class="t0">So lying forward weakly on the handrail</p>
<p class="t0">I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light</p>
<p class="t0">(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own</p>
<p class="t0">I could see nothing. “Toffile, I don’t see it.</p>
<p class="t0">It’s with us in the room though. It’s the bones.”</p>
<p class="t0">“What bones?” “The cellar bones—out of the grave.”</p>
<p class="t0">That made him throw his bare legs out of bed</p>
<p class="t0">And sit up by me and take hold of me.</p>
<p class="t0">I wanted to put out the light and see</p>
<p class="t0">If I could see it, or else mow the room,</p>
<p class="t0">With our arms at the level of our knees,</p>
<p class="t0">And bring the chalk-pile down. “I’ll tell you what—</p>
<p class="t0">It’s looking for another door to try.</p>
<p class="t0">The uncommonly deep snow has made him think</p>
<p class="t0">Of his old song, <i>The Wild Colonial Boy</i>,</p>
<p class="t0">He always used to sing along the tote-road.</p>
<p class="t0">He’s after an open door to get out-doors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p class="t0">Let’s trap him with an open door up attic.”</p>
<p class="t0">Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough,</p>
<p class="t0">Almost the moment he was given an opening,</p>
<p class="t0">The steps began to climb the attic stairs.</p>
<p class="t0">I heard them. Toffile didn’t seem to hear them.</p>
<p class="t0">“Quick!” I slammed to the door and held the knob.</p>
<p class="t0">“Toffile, get nails.” I made him nail the door shut,</p>
<p class="t0">And push the headboard of the bed against it.</p>
<p class="t0">Then we asked was there anything</p>
<p class="t0">Up attic that we’d ever want again.</p>
<p class="t0">The attic was less to us than the cellar.</p>
<p class="t0">If the bones liked the attic, let them have it,</p>
<p class="t0">Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes</p>
<p class="t0">Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed</p>
<p class="t0">Behind the door and headboard of the bed,</p>
<p class="t0">Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,</p>
<p class="t0">With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,</p>
<p class="t0">That’s what I sit up in the dark to say—</p>
<p class="t0">To no one any more since Toffile died.</p>
<p class="t0">Let them stay in the attic since they went there.</p>
<p class="t0">I promised Toffile to be cruel to them</p>
<p class="t0">For helping them be cruel once to him.</p>

<p class="t"><i>Son.</i> We never could find out whose bones they were.</p>

<p class="t"><i>Mother.</i> Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for once.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>

<p class="t0">Son looks surprised to see me end a lie</p>
<p class="t0">We’d kept all these years between ourselves</p>
<p class="t0">So as to have it ready for outsiders.</p>
<p class="t0">But tonight I don’t care enough to lie—</p>
<p class="t0">I don’t remember why I ever cared.</p>
<p class="t0">Toffile, if he were here, I don’t believe</p>
<p class="t0">Could tell you why he ever cared himself . . .</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She hadn’t found the finger-bone she wanted</p>

<h3 id="ch13">II. THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now that they’ve got it settled whose I be,</p>
<p class="t0">I’m going to tell them something they won’t like:</p>
<p class="t0">They’ve got it settled wrong, and I can prove it.</p>
<p class="t0">Flattered I must be to have two towns fighting</p>
<p class="t0">To make a present of me to each other.</p>
<p class="t0">They don’t dispose me, either one of them,</p>
<p class="t0">To spare them any trouble. Double trouble’s</p>
<p class="t0">Always the witch’s motto anyway.</p>
<p class="t0">I’ll double theirs for both of them—you watch me.</p>
<p class="t0">They’ll find they’ve got the whole thing to do over,</p>
<p class="t0">That is, if facts is what they want to go by.</p>
<p class="t0">They set a lot (now don’t they?) by a record</p>
<p class="t0">Of Arthur Amy’s having once been up</p>
<p class="t0">For Hog Reeve in March Meeting here in Warren.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p class="t0">I could have told them any time this twelvemonth</p>
<p class="t0">The Arthur Amy I was married to</p>
<p class="t0">Couldn’t have been the one they say was up</p>
<p class="t0">In Warren at March Meeting for the reason</p>
<p class="t0">He wa’n’t but fifteen at the time they say.</p>
<p class="t0">The Arthur Amy I was married to</p>
<p class="t0">Voted the only times he ever voted,</p>
<p class="t0">Which wasn’t many, in the town of Wentworth.</p>
<p class="t0">One of the times was when ’twas in the warrant</p>
<p class="t0">To see if the town wanted to take over</p>
<p class="t0">The tote road to our clearing where we lived.</p>
<p class="t0">I’ll tell you who’d remember—Heman Lapish.</p>
<p class="t0">Their Arthur Amy was the father of mine.</p>
<p class="t0">So now they’ve dragged it through the law courts once</p>
<p class="t0">I guess they’d better drag it through again.</p>
<p class="t0">Wentworth and Warren’s both good towns to live in,</p>
<p class="t0">Only I happen to prefer to live</p>
<p class="t0">In Wentworth from now on; and when all’s said,</p>
<p class="t0">Right’s right, and the temptation to do right</p>
<p class="t0">When I can hurt someone by doing it</p>
<p class="t0">Has always been too much for me, it has.</p>
<p class="t0">I know of some folks that’d be set up</p>
<p class="t0">At having in their town a noted witch:</p>
<p class="t0">But most would have to think of the expense</p>
<p class="t0">That even I would be. They ought to know</p>
<p class="t0">That as a witch I’d often milk a bat</p>
<p class="t0">And that’d be enough to last for days.</p>
<p class="t0">It’d make my position stronger, think,</p>
<p class="t0">If I was to consent to give some sign</p>
<p class="t0">To make it surer that I was a witch?</p>
<p class="t0">It wa’n’t no sign, I s’pose, when Mallice Huse</p>
<p class="t0">Said that I took him out in his old age</p>
<p class="t0">And rode all over everything on him</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p class="t0">Until I’d had him worn to skin and bones.</p>
<p class="t0">And if I’d left him hitched unblanketed</p>
<p class="t0">In front of one Town Hall, I’d left him hitched</p>
<p class="t0">In front of every one in Grafton County.</p>
<p class="t0">Some cried shame on me not to blanket him,</p>
<p class="t0">The poor old man. It would have been all right</p>
<p class="t0">If some one hadn’t said to gnaw the posts</p>
<p class="t0">He stood beside and leave his trade mark on them,</p>
<p class="t0">So they could recognize them. Not a post</p>
<p class="t0">That they could hear tell of was scarified.</p>
<p class="t0">They made him keep on gnawing till he whined.</p>
<p class="t0">Then that same smarty someone said to look—</p>
<p class="t0">He’d bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawed</p>
<p class="t0">The crib he slept in—and as sure’s you’re born</p>
<p class="t0">They found he’d gnawed the four posts of his bed,</p>
<p class="t0">All four of them to splinters. What did that prove?</p>
<p class="t0">Not that he hadn’t gnawed the hitching posts</p>
<p class="t0">He said he had besides. Because a horse</p>
<p class="t0">Gnaws in the stable ain’t no proof to me</p>
<p class="t0">He don’t gnaw trees and posts and fences too.</p>
<p class="t0">But everybody took it for a proof.</p>
<p class="t0">I was a strapping girl of twenty then.</p>
<p class="t0">The smarty someone who spoiled everything</p>
<p class="t0">Was Arthur Amy. You know who he was.</p>
<p class="t0">That was the way he started courting me.</p>
<p class="t0">He never said much after we were married,</p>
<p class="t0">But I mistrusted he was none too proud</p>
<p class="t0">Of having interfered in the Huse business.</p>
<p class="t0">I guess he found he got more out of me</p>
<p class="t0">By having me a witch. Or something happened</p>
<p class="t0">To turn him round. He got to saying things</p>
<p class="t0">To undo what he’d done and make it right,</p>
<p class="t0">Like, “No, she ain’t come back from kiting yet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p class="t0">Last night was one of her nights out. She’s kiting.</p>
<p class="t0">She thinks when the wind makes a night of it</p>
<p class="t0">She might as well herself.” But he liked best</p>
<p class="t0">To let on he was plagued to death with me:</p>
<p class="t0">If anyone had seen me coming home</p>
<p class="t0">Over the ridgepole, ’stride of a broomstick,</p>
<p class="t0">As often as he had in the tail of the night,</p>
<p class="t0">He guessed they’d know what he had to put up with.</p>
<p class="t0">Well, I showed Arthur Amy signs enough</p>
<p class="t0">Off from the house as far as we could keep</p>
<p class="t0">And from barn smells you can’t wash out of ploughed ground</p>
<p class="t0">With all the rain and snow of seven years;</p>
<p class="t0">And I don’t mean just skulls of Roger’s Rangers</p>
<p class="t0">On Moosilauke, but woman signs to man,</p>
<p class="t0">Only bewitched so I would last him longer.</p>
<p class="t0">Up where the trees grow short, the mosses tall,</p>
<p class="t0">I made him gather me wet snow berries</p>
<p class="t0">On slippery rocks beside a waterfall.</p>
<p class="t0">I made him do it for me in the dark.</p>
<p class="t0">And he liked everything I made him do.</p>
<p class="t0">I hope if he is where he sees me now</p>
<p class="t0">He’s so far off he can’t see what I’ve come to.</p>
<p class="t0">You <i>can</i> come down from everything to nothing.</p>
<p class="t0">All is, if I’d a-known when I was young</p>
<p class="t0">And full of it, that this would be the end,</p>
<p class="t0">It doesn’t seem as if I’d had the courage</p>
<p class="t0">To make so free and kick up in folks’ faces.</p>
<p class="t0">I might have, but it doesn’t seem as if.</p>

<p class="t0">Who used to live here. They were Robinsons.</p>
<p class="t0">You must have heard of Clara Robinson,</p>
<p class="t0">The poetess who wrote the book of verses</p>
<p class="t0">And had it published. It was all about</p>
<p class="t0">The posies on her inner window sill,</p>
<p class="t0">And the birds on her outer window sill,</p>
<p class="t0">And how she tended both, or had them tended:</p>
<p class="t0">She never tended anything herself.</p>
<p class="t0">She was ‘shut in’ for life. She lived her whole</p>
<p class="t0">Life long in bed, and wrote her things in bed.</p>
<p class="t0">I’ll show you how she had her sills extended</p>
<p class="t0">To entertain the birds and hold the flowers.</p>
<p class="t0">Our business first’s up attic with her books.”</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We trod uncomfortably on crunching glass</p>
<p class="t0">Through a house stripped of everything</p>
<p class="t0">Except, it seemed, the poetess’s poems.</p>
<p class="t0">Books, I should say!—if books are what is needed.</p>
<p class="t0">A whole edition in a packing-case,</p>
<p class="t0">That, overflowing like a horn of plenty,</p>
<p class="t0">Or like the poetess’s heart of love,</p>
<p class="t0">Had spilled them near the window toward the light,</p>
<p class="t0">Where driven rain had wet and swollen them.</p>
<p class="t0">Enough to stock a village library—</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p class="t0">Unfortunately all of one kind, though.</p>
<p class="t0">They had been brought home from some publisher</p>
<p class="t0">And taken thus into the family.</p>
<p class="t0">Boys and bad hunters had known what to do</p>
<p class="t0">With stone and lead to unprotected glass:</p>
<p class="t0">Shatter it inward on the unswept floors.</p>
<p class="t0">How had the tender verse escaped their outrage?</p>
<p class="t0">By being invisible for what it was,</p>
<p class="t0">Or else by some remoteness that defied them</p>
<p class="t0">To find out what to do to hurt a poem.</p>
<p class="t0">Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,</p>
<p class="t0">To send it sailing out the attic window</p>
<p class="t0">Till it caught the wind, and, opening out its covers,</p>
<p class="t0">Tried to improve on sailing like a tile</p>
<p class="t0">By flying like a bird (silent in flight,</p>
<p class="t0">But all the burden of its body song),</p>
<p class="t0">Only to tumble like a stricken bird,</p>
<p class="t0">And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.</p>
<p class="t0">Books were not thrown irreverently about.</p>
<p class="t0">They simply lay where some one now and then,</p>
<p class="t0">Having tried one, had dropped it at his feet</p>
<p class="t0">And left it lying where it fell rejected.</p>
<p class="t0">Here were all those the poetess’s life</p>
<p class="t0">Had been too short to sell or give away.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Take one,” Old Davis bade me graciously.</p>

<p class="t0">“Why not take two or three?”</p>

<p class="t12">“Take all you want.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>

<p class="t0">The attic wasps went missing by like bullets.</p>
</div>

<p class="t0">I was soon satisfied for the time being.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All the way home I kept remembering</p>
<p class="t0">The small book in my pocket. It was there.</p>
<p class="t0">The poetess had sighed, I knew, in heaven</p>
<p class="t0">At having eased her heart of one more copy—</p>
<p class="t0">Legitimately. My demand upon her,</p>
<p class="t0">Though slight, was a demand. She felt the tug.</p>

<h2 id="ch30">GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This saying good-bye on the edge of the dark</p>
<p class="t0">And cold to an orchard so young in the bark</p>
<p class="t0">Reminds me of all that can happen to harm</p>
<p class="t0">An orchard away at the end of the farm</p>
<p class="t0">All winter, cut off by a hill from the house.</p>
<p class="t0">I don’t want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,</p>
<p class="t0">I don’t want it dreamily nibbled for browse</p>
<p class="t0">By deer, and I don’t want it budded by grouse.</p>
<p class="t0">(If certain it wouldn’t be idle to call</p>
<p class="t0">I’d summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall</p>
<p class="t0">And warn them away with a stick for a gun.)</p>
<p class="t0">I don’t want it stirred by the heat of the sun.</p>
<p class="t0">(We made it secure against being, I hope,</p>
<p class="t0">By setting it out on a northerly slope.)</p>
<p class="t0">No orchard’s the worse for the wintriest storm;</p>
<p class="t0">But one thing about it, it mustn’t get warm.</p>
<p class="t0">“How often already you’ve had to be told,</p>
<p class="t0">Keep cold, young orchard. Good-bye and keep cold.</p>
<p class="t0">Dread fifty above more than fifty below.”</p>
<p class="t0">I have to be gone for a season or so.</p>
<p class="t0">My business awhile is with different trees,</p>
<p class="t0">Less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,</p>
<p class="t0">And such as is done to their wood with an axe—</p>
<p class="t0">Maples and birches and tamaracks.</p>
<p class="t0">I wish I could promise to lie in the night</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love and forgetting might have carried them</p>
<p class="t0">A little further up the mountain side</p>
<p class="t0">With night so near, but not much further up.</p>
<p class="t0">They must have halted soon in any case</p>
<p class="t0">With thoughts of the path back, how rough it was</p>
<p class="t0">With rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness;</p>
<p class="t0">When they were halted by a tumbled wall</p>
<p class="t0">With barbed-wire binding. They stood facing this,</p>
<p class="t0">Spending what onward impulse they still had</p>
<p class="t0">In one last look the way they must not go,</p>
<p class="t0">On up the failing path, where, if a stone</p>
<p class="t0">Or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself;</p>
<p class="t0">No footstep moved it. “This is all,” they sighed,</p>
<p class="t0">“Good-night to woods.” But not so; there was more.</p>
<p class="t0">A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them</p>
<p class="t0">Across the wall, as near the wall as they.</p>
<p class="t0">She saw them in their field, they her in hers.</p>
<p class="t0">The difficulty of seeing what stood still,</p>
<p class="t0">Like some up-ended boulder split in two,</p>
<p class="t0">Was in her clouded eyes: they saw no fear there.</p>
<p class="t0">She seemed to think that two thus they were safe.</p>
<p class="t0">Then, as if they were something that, though strange,</p>
<p class="t0">She could not trouble her mind with too long,</p>
<p class="t0">She sighed and passed unscared along the wall.</p>
<p class="t0">“<i>This</i>, then, is all. What more is there to ask?”</p>
<p class="t0">But no, not yet. A snort to bid them wait.</p>
<p class="t0">A buck from round the spruce stood looking at them</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p class="t0">Across the wall as near the wall as they.</p>
<p class="t0">This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril,</p>
<p class="t0">Not the same doe come back into her place.</p>
<p class="t0">He viewed them quizzically with jerks of head,</p>
<p class="t0">As if to ask, “Why don’t you make some motion?</p>
<p class="t0">Or give some sign of life? Because you can’t.</p>
<p class="t0">I doubt if you’re as living as you look.”</p>
<p class="t0">Thus till he had them almost feeling dared</p>
<p class="t0">To stretch a proffering hand—and a spell-breaking.</p>
<p class="t0">Then he too passed unscared along the wall.</p>
<p class="t0">Two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from.</p>
<p class="t0">“This <i>must</i> be all.” It was all. Still they stood,</p>
<p class="t0">A great wave from it going over them,</p>
<p class="t0">As if the earth in one unlooked-for favor</p>
<p class="t0">Had made them certain earth returned their love.</p>

<p class="t0">Under the formal writing, he was in her sight,</p>

<p class="t0">How else? They are not known to send the dead—</p>
<p class="t0">And not disfigured visibly. His face?</p>
<p class="t0">His hands? She had to look, to ask,</p>
<p class="t0">“What is it, dear?” And she had given all</p>
<p class="t0">And still she had all—<i>they</i> had—they the lucky!</p>
<p class="t0">Wasn’t she glad now? Everything seemed won,</p>
<p class="t0">And all the rest for them permissible ease.</p>
<p class="t0">She had to ask, “What was it, dear?”</p>
<p class="t14">“Enough,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet not enough. A bullet through and through,</p>
<p class="t0">High in the breast. Nothing but what good care</p>
<p class="t0">And medicine and rest, and you a week,</p>

<p class="t0">Grim giving to do over for them both.</p>
<p class="t0">She dared no more than ask him with her eyes</p>
<p class="t0">How was it with him for a second trial.</p>
<p class="t0">And with his eyes he asked her not to ask.</p>

<p class="t0">They made no white impression on the black.</p>
<p class="t0">They disappeared as if earth sent them back.</p>
<p class="t0">Not till from separate flakes they changed at night</p>
<p class="t0">To almost strips and tapes of ragged white</p>
<p class="t0">Did grass and garden ground confess it snowed,</p>
<p class="t0">And all go back to winter but the road.</p>
<p class="t0">Next day the scene was piled and puffed and dead.</p>
<p class="t0">The grass lay flattened under one great tread.</p>
<p class="t0">Borne down until the end almost took root,</p>
<p class="t0">The rangey bough anticipated fruit</p>
<p class="t0">With snowballs cupped in every opening bud.</p>
<p class="t0">The road alone maintained itself in mud,</p>
<p class="t0">Whatever its secret was of greater heat</p>
<p class="t0">From inward fires or brush of passing feet.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In spring more mortal singers than belong</p>
<p class="t0">To any one place cover us with song.</p>
<p class="t0">Thrush, bluebird, blackbird, sparrow, and robin throng;</p>
<p class="t0">Some to go further north to Hudson’s Bay,</p>
<p class="t0">Some that have come too far north back away,</p>
<p class="t0">Really a very few to build and stay.</p>
<p class="t0">Now was seen how these liked belated snow.</p>
<p class="t0">The fields had nowhere left for them to go;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p class="t0">They’d soon exhausted all there was in flying;</p>
<p class="t0">The trees they’d had enough of with once trying</p>
<p class="t0">And setting off their heavy powder load.</p>
<p class="t0">They could find nothing open but the road.</p>
<p class="t0">So there they let their lives be narrowed in</p>
<p class="t0">By thousands the bad weather made akin.</p>
<p class="t0">The road became a channel running flocks</p>
<p class="t0">Of glossy birds like ripples over rocks.</p>
<p class="t0">I drove them under foot in bits of flight</p>
<p class="t0">That kept the ground, almost disputing right</p>
<p class="t0">Of way with me from apathy of wing,</p>
<p class="t0">A talking twitter all they had to sing.</p>
<p class="t0">A few I must have driven to despair</p>
<p class="t0">Made quick asides, but having done in air</p>
<p class="t0">A whir among white branches great and small</p>
<p class="t0">As in some too much carven marble hall</p>
<p class="t0">Where one false wing beat would have brought down all,</p>
<p class="t0">Came tamely back in front of me, the Drover,</p>
<p class="t0">To suffer the same driven nightmare over.</p>
<p class="t0">One such storm in a lifetime couldn’t teach them</p>
<p class="t0">That back behind pursuit it couldn’t reach them;</p>
<p class="t0">None flew behind me to be left alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Well, something for a snowstorm to have shown</p>
<p class="t0">The country’s singing strength thus brought together,</p>
<p class="t0">That though repressed and moody with the weather</p>
<p class="t0">Was none the less there ready to be freed</p>
<p class="t0">And sing the wildflowers up from root and seed.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It went many years,</p>
<p class="t0">But at last came a knock,</p>
<p class="t0">And I thought of the door</p>
<p class="t0">With no lock to lock.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I blew out the light,</p>
<p class="t0">I tip-toed the floor,</p>
<p class="t0">And raised both hands</p>
<p class="t0">In prayer to the door.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But the knock came again.</p>
<p class="t0">My window was wide;</p>
<p class="t0">I climbed on the sill</p>
<p class="t0">And descended outside.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Back over the sill</p>
<p class="t0">I bade a “Come in”</p>
<p class="t0">To whatever the knock</p>
<p class="t0">At the door may have been.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So at a knock</p>
<p class="t0">I emptied my cage</p>
<p class="t0">To hide in the world</p>
<p class="t0">And alter with age.</p>

<p class="t0"><i>The house had gone to bring again</i></p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>The birds that came to it through the air</i></p>
